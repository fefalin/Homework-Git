Create a repository on your github account and when submitting the homework on the platform add the link to the repository.

To begin solving your homework:

On your github page, after creating a new repository, as we've learned click the green "Code" button and copy the URL from there (Pay attention, it's not the URL in the browser, it's the one you copy from the green button popup!)
In your terminal navigate to the folder where you work on your homework (eg: d /c/siit) and type git clone <paste-copied-url> and hit Enter
After cloning navigate into the newly created folder via your terminal terminal where you can type "code ." or you can open said folder from VSCode itself (File -> Open Folder). (This is not useful for this homework but will come in handy in the future!)
Now you can start coding or solving the homework!
When finished:
git add .
git commit -m "Finished homework"
git push
Don't forget you can add, commit and push as often as you want!!!!
By coincidence this homework does not require VSCode so there is no need to use it!


Homework:
Visit this link: Learn Git Branching

From the first tab, "Main", solve the firs 8 exercises (4 from "Introduction Sequence" and 4 from "Ramping up")
From the second tab "Remote" solve the first 11 exercises (8 from "Push and Pull" and 3 from "Origin and Beyond")

On both tabs create a screenshot with the solved exercises, Be sure one can see all solved exercises (the green buttons). Beside the solved exercises make sure the screenshot captures at least you whole browser window or optionally your whole screen!

In the folder you cloned above, put the screenshots you created. git add . -> git commit -m "Finished homework" -> git push. Check that your homework was uploaded to Github by going to Github and looking for the screenshots there.

Here on the platform you'll paste a URL of your repository (from the browser copy the url in the address bar) as the solution to mark the homework as done.
